Title : Extraction of Beta-Strands from protein structures 
=====================================================================================================================================
Description : This project aims at hands-on experience with protein structures. We are exposed to the definition of a 3-dimensional protein structure and manipulations with a 3-dimensional object.The task is to extract the position and the alignment of a beta strand using chimera tool.

Language : Python

Sample Output for Task-1:
Enter input file name: 1S04.pdb
NAMES:  TRP MET
Indices:  ('3', '5')
Vector:  ['-13.469', '1.179', '4.489'] ['-12.361', '0.148', '-2.201']
NAMES:  ILE PHE
Indices:  ('40', '42')
Vector:  ['-10.937', '-2.344', '4.272'] ['-12.064', '-4.422', '-1.684']
NAMES:  LEU ALA
Indices:  ('47', '53')
Vector:  ['-9.995', '-8.779', '-0.570'] ['-0.056', '0.602', '11.672']
NAMES:  GLU GLU
Indices:  ('104', '106')
Vector:  ['1.014', '-1.696', '6.602'] ['-2.715', '-7.368', '6.319']

Sample Output for Task-2:
======================================================================================================================================
->I used library numpy for this task. For that you need to install pip and wheel. Download the compatible numpy for your system and install.

->By using command prompt enter into the python folder wherever you have installed.

->Give python newtask2.py and hit enter.

->It then prompts to enter the input file name. Enter either 1NVF.pdb/1NVS.pdb/1S04.pdb/2P8Y.pdb/1AOP.pdb.

->It then generates a final.pdb file in the folder where newtask2.py is present. 

->Open final.pdb file in chimera.
